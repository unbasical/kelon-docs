# Deployment

Kelon can be easily integrated in your existing services with just a few lines of extra code by either integrating it 
in each service or i.e. your API-Gateway.

## Local

You can find more information on how to run Kelon as a standalone process [here](/core/overview/example/Run-Example/#from-source).

## Kubernetes

Kelon can also be deployed into Kubernetes with only a few configurations which is also available [here](https://github.com/unbasical/kelon-examples/tree/master/kube-mgmt-kelon-example) in our Kelon-Examples repository.
