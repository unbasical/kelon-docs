# Kelon and services

To integrate Kelon with your service you basically have to add middleware-code to your service which intercepts calls and sends them to Kelon for authorization

## Writing your own request interceptor

The core thing that each interceptor for Kelon needs to do is to gather all information about the incoming request and send it via a HTTP-POST to kelon for authorization (no mather which framework or programming language you want to use)

A possible call to Kelon for an incoming `GET /api/apps/1` might look like this:

**POST http://{Path to kelon}:{Port of kelon}/v1/data/allow**
```json
{
    "input": {
        "method": "GET",
        "path": "/api/apps/1",
        "token": "<JWT-Token from request header>"
    }
}
```

Please note that the only **required fields** inside the input object are **method** and **path**! All other fields can be added as you like and are available inside your policies by accessing them with i.e. `data.input.token`.

Kelon's will respond with a status code (200/401/403 / Allow/Unauthenticated/Unauthorized)


## Already existing interceptors for frameworks

Due to the fact that Kelon is compatible with OPA's Data-API, every solution written for the Open Policy Agent also works for kelon. There fore it is always advisable to have a look at the official [OPA-contrib repository](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/contrib) first. Please note that you may have to change the data format which is used to post the data to Kelon!

### Spring Boot

You can find an already existing implementation of an AccessDecisionVoter which can easily be integrated into existing Spring applicaitons [here](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/contrib/tree/master/spring_authz). Please note that you may have to change the data format which is used to post the data to Kelon!

### Dart

There is also an implementation for [Dart applications](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/contrib/tree/master/dart_authz). Please note that you may have to change the data format which is used to post the data to Kelon!

### Golang

An example with golang is avaliable [here](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/example-api-authz-go). Please note that you may have to change the data format which is used to post the data to Kelon!

### Python

An example with python can be found [here](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/example-api-authz-python). Please note that you may have to change the data format which is used to post the data to Kelon!
